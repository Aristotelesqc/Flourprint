# Contract: bake session (D7)

Status: **approved** (issue #30). Related issues: #6, #21, #24.

## Commands and events

```ts
interface BakeCommand<P> {
  commandId: string; // stable across retries
  bakeId: string;
  expectedVersion: number; // last known seq
  issuedAt: Instant;
  payload: P;
}

interface BakeEvent<P> {
  eventId: string;
  bakeId: string;
  seq: number; // 1, 2, 3… per bake
  causationId: string; // commandId
  occurredAt: Instant; // business time, may be declared by the user
  recordedAt: Instant; // device clock at write time
  schemaVersion: number;
  type: string;
  payload: P;
}
```

## Pure domain

- `decide(state, command, now) → Result<EventPayload[], DomainError>` validates transitions (no
  double completion of a step, corrections target an existing correctable event).
- `evolve(state, event) → state` is **structural**: it never calls the calculation engine.
  Computed values live in the events (`history.md`).
- One command may produce several events, written atomically.
- Corrections are typed events (`StepTimeCorrected { targetEventId, newOccurredAt }`,
  `StepCompletionRetracted { targetEventId }`, …). The original is never modified.
- The actual record includes times, observations and optional physical measurements
  (`Observation`). Missing data stays missing.

## Repository (SQLite adapter)

One transaction per command:

1. `commandId` already recorded with the same content hash → return the stored result; different
   hash → `CommandIdReused`. **This check runs before the version check.**
2. Current version ≠ `expectedVersion` → `VersionConflict { currentVersion }`.
3. Append the events (`UNIQUE(bake_id, seq)`), update the index row, record the command, commit.

- **Strict** conflicts, no merging of compatible commands: the UI reloads and decides again.
- The UI confirms an action only after the durable write succeeded.
- `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and `SQLITE_BUSY` handling (single connection on mobile, bounded retries) are
  to be proven in #24.

## Recipes

Recipes have no events: an edit creates a new revision, with an optimistic check on the expected
head revision.
