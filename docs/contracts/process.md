# Contract: process (D3)

Status: **approved** (issue #30). Related issues: #5, #9, #21, #28.

## Model

A process is an open list of repeatable **step instances** (one stable ID per instance), linked by
finish-to-start dependencies. The business content of a step (operation, target, dough state,
conditions, incorporations) follows #5; this contract fixes the graph and the timing.

```ts
interface ProcessStep {
  id: StepId;
  dependsOn: StepId[]; // finish-to-start
  schedule: 'asap' | 'alap';
  plannedDurationS?: number; // absent = unknown
  endCriterion?: EndCriterion; // observation or user decision
}
```

## Validation

- References exist, no self-dependency, no cycle.
- The list order is a **valid topological order**: the mobile list reads top to bottom.
- A step added to the list gets `dependsOn = [previous step]` by default.
- `alap` without a successor is an error.
- Per-step incorporations add up exactly to the formula's final-mix quantities.
- `dependsOn` is never accepted and then ignored, nor dropped on import.

## Projection

- Modes: start now, start at a time, ready by a time (target: a designated terminal step).
- `asap`: as early as its dependencies allow. `alap`: as late as possible while still ending
  before the **earliest** planned start of its successors (preheating, tangzhong).
- Replanning during a bake: freeze recorded facts (actual starts and ends) → forward pass for
  `asap` steps → backward pass for `alap` steps not yet started. Replanning covers **the whole
  future plan**, not only successors of the changed step.
- An end conditioned on an observation, without an accepted estimate, makes downstream times
  `unknownAfter: StepId[]`.
- No step completes automatically because its planned duration has elapsed.
- The scheduler only does time arithmetic. Biological continuity (fermentation during handling)
  belongs to #9/#29.

Implemented utilities: `topologicalSort`, `isTopologicalOrder`, `validateReferences`
(`@flourprint/core/domain`).
