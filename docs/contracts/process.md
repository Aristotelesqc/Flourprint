# Contract: process (D3)

Status: **approved** (issue #30). Related issues: #5, #9, #21, #28.

## Model

A process is an open list of repeatable **step instances** (one stable ID per instance), linked by
finish-to-start dependencies. The business content of a step (operation, target, dough state,
conditions, incorporations) follows #5; this contract fixes the graph and the timing.

```ts
interface ProcessStep {
  id: StepId;
  dependsOn: StepId[]; // finish-to-start
  schedule: 'asap' | 'alap';
  plannedDurationS?: number; // absent = unknown
  endCriterion?: EndCriterion; // observation or user decision
  accepted?: AcceptedSuggestion; // set when plannedDurationS was taken from a model suggestion
}
```

`AcceptedSuggestion` is defined in `fermentation.md`. For a step, `appliedValue` is
`plannedDurationS` in seconds. Any other edit of `plannedDurationS` removes `accepted`.

## Validation

- Step ids are non-empty and unique; names of built-in object members (`__proto__`,
  `constructor`, …) are refused, as in `formula.md`.
- References exist, no self-dependency, no cycle.
- The list order is a **valid topological order**: the mobile list reads top to bottom.
- A step added to the list gets `dependsOn = [previous step]` by default.
- `alap` without a successor, or without `plannedDurationS`, is an error.
- `plannedDurationS` ≥ 0 when present.
- Per-step incorporations add up exactly to the formula's final-mix quantities (see below).
- `dependsOn` is never accepted and then ignored, nor dropped on import.

## Incorporations

A step may declare what it adds to the dough, as shares of final-mix items:

```ts
type Incorporation =
  | { item: 'flour' | 'ingredient' | 'component'; id: string; sharePct: number }
  | { item: 'water'; sharePct: number }; // the final-mix water pool
```

- `ingredient` refers to a non-water dough ingredient; `component` to a whole component.
- Incorporations are optional. When a process declares any, every final-mix item with a positive
  mass must be incorporated exactly once in total (shares summing to 100 across steps), and no
  item may exceed 100. Unknown references are errors.
- Grams per step are derived from the resolved formula, so they follow every rescaling.

## Step conditions

```ts
interface StepConditions {
  location?: string; // open code: counter, fridge, proofer, oven…
  temperatureC?: number; // ambient temperature of the step
  doughTemperatureC?: number; // mix step only: target dough temperature (advanced mode)
  frictionC?: number; // mix step only: mixer friction for the water temperature
}
```

- `temperatureC` is the ambient the dough sits in. `doughTemperatureC` and `frictionC` are only
  read on a `mix` step; elsewhere they are refused (`InvalidProcess`). Their use is defined in
  fermentation.md.
- All temperatures are in °C and finite; the scheduler ignores them.

## Step removal

Removing a step rewires each of its successors to the removed step's own dependencies, so the
order around it is kept; incorporations it declared are removed with it and the result is
validated like any process (a recipe whose incorporations no longer match its formula is
refused).

## Projection

- Modes: start at a time (start now is start at `now`), or ready by a time for a designated
  target step. Ready-by plans the whole process as early as possible from an origin, then shifts
  the origin so the target ends at the requested time; it needs known durations up to the target
  and is only valid before the bake has started.
- A step's planned end is known only when its start is known and it has `plannedDurationS`.
  Started and finished steps use their recorded times.
- During a bake, steps not yet started cannot be planned before `now`.
- `asap`: as early as its dependencies allow. `alap`: as late as possible while still ending
  before the **earliest** planned start of its successors (preheating, tangzhong).
- Replanning during a bake: freeze recorded facts (actual starts and ends) → forward pass for
  `asap` steps → backward pass for `alap` steps not yet started. Replanning covers **the whole
  future plan**, not only successors of the changed step.
- An end conditioned on an observation, without an accepted estimate, makes downstream times
  `unknownAfter: StepId[]`.
- No step completes automatically because its planned duration has elapsed.
- The scheduler only does time arithmetic. Biological continuity (fermentation during handling)
  belongs to #9/#29.

Implementation (`@flourprint/core/domain`): `validateProcess`, `projectProcess`,
`planIncorporations`, and the graph utilities `topologicalSort`, `isTopologicalOrder`,
`validateReferences`.
